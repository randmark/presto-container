# presto-container
 
Presto Container is a self-contained demonstration of using the Starburst Presto container to connect to multiple repositories.

You will need to modify the catalogs in the catalog directory to connect to your data sources as discussed here: https://docs.starburstdata.com/latest/connector/starburst-connectors.html

This is a demo being shown at the Postgres Conference webinar, and more updates will come.
